üöÄ RapidAid
An intelligent emergency alert platform designed to provide faster, verified help in critical situations.

Problem
In emergencies (medical, safety, or disasters), response is often delayed due to a lack of verified information, false alarms, and poor coordination. First responders are overwhelmed, and victims in real, verifiable danger get lost in the noise.

Solution
RapidAid solves this by introducing a "Dynamic Trust Score" for every SOS alert. Our platform analyzes multiple data points to verify the legitimacy of an alert in real-time, prioritizing critical cases and routing them instantly to nearby, verified responders.

‚ú® Core Features
‚ö° Real-Time SOS Alerts: A one-tap SOS button to instantly send an alert with live GPS coordinates.

üß† Dynamic Trust Score: An intelligent scoring system that calculates the legitimacy of an alert based on:

Identity Verification: A mock DigiLocker check to verify the user's identity.

Circle of Trust: Verification requests sent to the user's pre-approved emergency contacts.

Sensor Data: (Planned) Analysis of on-device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope) to detect events like falls or crashes.

üó∫Ô∏è Live Geo-Mapping: A real-time map for responders showing the location of all active alerts, color-coded by their Trust Score.

üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Emergency Contacts: Users can add a "Circle of Trust" (2-6 members) who are notified during an SOS.

üîí Secure Authentication: User sign-up and login handled securely by Firebase Authentication.

üíª Tech Stack
Frontend: FlutterFlow (Flutter)

Backend: Firebase

Cloud Functions: (Managed in VS Code) for secure, server-side logic.

Firestore: NoSQL database for storing user data, alerts, and contacts.

Firebase Authentication: For user login and registration.

Cloud Storage: For user-uploaded files (like profile photos).

Maps & Geolocation: Google Maps Platform

‚òÅÔ∏è Backend Cloud Functions
Our core backend logic is built with Node.js and deployed via the Firebase CLI.

verifyIdentity: A callable function that updates a user's profile in Firestore when they complete the mock identity verification, boosting their base trust.

addTrustedContact: A callable function that securely adds a contact's phone number to a user's "Circle of Trust" array in Firestore.

createSOSAlert (Planned): The central function to create an alert, calculate its initial Trust Score, and trigger notifications.

üß≠ Project Workflow
Onboarding: A user signs up and is encouraged to verify their identity and add emergency contacts.

SOS Trigger: The user presses the SOS button. Their location and sensor data are sent to the backend.

Verification: The createSOSAlert function calculates the initial Trust Score. It simultaneously pings the user's "Circle of Trust" for secondary verification.

Response: The alert appears on the responder's map, prioritized by its score. A high-score alert (e.g., from a verified user whose contacts confirm the emergency) is escalated for immediate action.
